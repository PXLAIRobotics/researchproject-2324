## DARTS: Digitized Automatic Rapid Tally System

In this project, you will develop a comprehensive software application that integrates computer vision, real-time data visualization, and a user-friendly graphical interface to analyze and display various aspects of a darts game. The backend will be created in Python (Django or Fast API), the frontend must be a web application (a JavaScript framework of your choice). Within your project team, you will apply SCRUM/Agile techniques to ensure a smooth workflow and team process throughout the project.
